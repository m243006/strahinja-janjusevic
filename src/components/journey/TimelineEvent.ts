    details: "During my time at the United States Naval Academy, I pursued a dual major in Cyber Operations and Computer Science, graduating with a strong foundation in both technical expertise and leadership. As part of the prestigious NSA Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) program, I honed my skills in cybersecurity, focusing on threat intelligence, network defense, and operational methodologies. My capstone project introduced an innovative approach to tracking threat actors, leveraging reputation-based systems to enhance network intrusion detection and attribution. Beyond academics, I served in leadership roles as a Squad Leader and Drill Officer, mentoring peers and ensuring the success of over 140 midshipmen. These experiences not only deepened my technical knowledge but also instilled a strong sense of discipline, teamwork, and commitment to excellenceâ€”qualities that continue to drive my work in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.",
